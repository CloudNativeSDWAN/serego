# Contributing to SeReGo

Welcome and thank you so much for considering contributing to SeReGo!

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution
process smoother, easier and faster for everyone. Here you will learn about
the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing,
and merging the PR.

## Code of Conduct

By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to respect our
[Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md). Please make sure you have read and
understood it, and that you are respectful and friendly in all of our spaces.

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via *Issues* and *Pull Requests* (PRs).
There are many ways you can give your contribution to SeReGo:

- Improving documentation
- Tutorials
- Blog posts
- Submitting bug reports
- Submitting feature requests
- Writing code

We kindly ask you to search for potentially already existing issues or pull
requests before making your contribution.

### Discussions

For help in using the project, e.g. use-case examples or installation, please
open a new discussion in the *Discussion* section rather than opening issues.
This will allow contributors and owners to better organize their time and
priorities for the project.

We just kindly ask you to refrain from asking for help regarding things that
are not really related to SeReGo, e.g. how to set timeouts to requests or help
about a certain service registry's usage and features: while we are more than
happy to be help you, this may be time consuming, especially when having
multiple Issues and PRs to work on. As a result, your discussion may be
prematurely closed.

If you do have this kind of questions, please redirect them to other places,
e.g. *StackOverflow* or other dedicated communities.

### Security vulnerabilities

Please **do not** disclose security vulnerabilites publicly, that is neither on
discussions nor issues. Instead, talk about it privately with one of the
[owners](./OWNERS.md) of the project or at `contact@cnwan.io`.

For example, if you find that the project accidentally exposes - e.g. prints on
console or logs - a password or any sensitive data, you should bring this
privately.

Typos, unexpected errors, crashes or anything that does not expose sensitive
data or does not allow for unauthorized actions must be brought up in *Issues*.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new
feature, or to discuss changes before a PR is created. When you create a new
Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and
providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your
own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new
one. Adding a
[reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is
affecting more than just the reporter.

We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending
on the issue and its importance/priority, it could take a while to investigate
it. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can
help draw attention if your issue is blocking, but please don't make too mamy
in a short time.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix
or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread
  whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test
  suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when
  a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes
(e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal
first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the
["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr):

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can
   efficiently review the changes.

## Getting Help

Join us in the *Discussions* section and post your question there in the
correct category with a descriptive tag.
